# Day 1 continued part 1: created preliminary folder
Today, I created the preliminary folder structure for the project and added the necessary files inside. This marks the beginning of organizing the development environment for the operating system project. In parallel, I also started reviewing the basics of C programming to prepare for upcoming tasks in kernel and bootloader development.
