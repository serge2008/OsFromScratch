# OS From Scratch

Welcome to the **OS From Scratch** project! This repository chronicles the journey of building a custom operating system from scratch, including the development of:
- A custom **bootloader**
- A lightweight **kernel**
- A custom **graphics library**

## About the Project
This project is developed with the following goals:
1. **Learning**: Deepening knowledge of low-level programming in C and assembly.
2. **Exploration**: Understanding the principles of operating system design.
3. **Documentation**: Providing a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in OS development.

### Tools & Environment
- **Development Platform**: Windows with MSYS2
- **Programming Languages**: C, Assembly
- **External Tools**: GNU utilities, QEMU (or other emulators)

```

### Subfolder Contents
- Each subfolder (`Bootloader`, `GraphicsLibrary`, `Kernel`) includes:
  - A `README.MD` for specific documentation.
  - `DayX.MD` files detailing daily progress.
  - Relevant source code files for that component.

## Getting Started
To follow along with the development process:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Explore the `DayX.MD` files for insights into the daily progress and learning.
3. Refer to the code in each subfolder to see implementation details.

## Roadmap
- **Bootloader**: Initial setup, transitioning control to the kernel.
- **Kernel**: Basic system calls, memory management, and multitasking.
- **Graphics Library**: Custom rendering and UI components.

## Contributing
While this is primarily a personal learning project, feedback and suggestions are welcome!
